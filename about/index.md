I'm a 22 years old Software Engineer and Data Analyst that works for Reliant Solutions as an intern. I have a degree in Computer Engineering, but I'm really not into _hardware_ programming. Got tired of dealing with microcontrollers powered by thousands of Assembly lines. I really love working with Backend Development, designing APIs and writing comprehensible code is my jam.
